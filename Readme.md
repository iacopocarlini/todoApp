# ToDo App (version 1.0.0)

This is a simple **React Native + sqlite** app developed as a personal project. Feel free to copy or modify it. 

<br /> 

# Features

- Add a todo/task to the list, so that you don't forget things
- Set the priority for that todo (ðŸ”´: important ... âš«: not important at all)
- Todos are sorted according to their priority

<br /> 

# Development features

- Under "utils" there is a logger class to have some kind of formatted logging at runtime. It has a switch so it can be turned on/off.

<br /> 

# Future Development

- Export todo list as a csv or json file
- Better UI design
- Enable logging from UI
